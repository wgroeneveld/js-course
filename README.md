## (Slides) Setup

Made with Reveal.js (http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) - please see installation instructions there. You'll need node and grunt to install dependencies. Use "grunt serve" to start the local server. A subdirectory named "img" should be created with all images. The slideshow html file should be placed in the root of the revealjs cloned git directory.
